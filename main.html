	<h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>
	<p1>
		Time complexity is used to measure how efficient an algorithm is based on the time it takes to execute as the input size increases. An efficient algorithm has lower time complexity and performs better.
	</p1>
	
	<p2>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to run. In many cases, the space usage grows as O(n), where n is the input size.
